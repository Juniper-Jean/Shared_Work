My CMEE 2016-17 Coursework Repository

This repository contains assignments I submitted for the coursework part of a Master's in Computational Methods in Ecology and Evolution (CMEE). Each directory has a readme, detailing its files.

An overview of assignment topics per directory:

### 'Week1' - UNIX, October 3-7 ###
The UNIX bash shell
	Basic UNIX commands
	Redirect a command's output to a file
	Concatenate commands using 'pipes' '|'
	Find files using wildcards or the 'find' command
	Match strings in a file using the 'grep' command

UNIX shell scripting

Using LaTeX for scientific documents
	BibTeX bibliography manager
	Bash script to compile LaTeX


### 'Week2' - Basic Python ###
Assign variables

Data structures - list, tuple, set, dictionary

Input/output

Control statements - 'if', 'else', 'elif'
Loops - 'for', 'while'

Compartmentalise code - functions and modules

Debugging and unit testing
	'doctest' package
	Use 'pdb' to turn on the debugger
	Breakpoints - use 'ipdb.set_trace()' to pause programs and start debugging


### 'Week3' - R (statistical software with programming capabilities), October 17-21 ###
Assign variables
Variable types and type conversion

Data structures - make, manipulate, index, view
	Vector - like one column/row
	Matrix - a 2 dimensional vector
	Data frame - each column has a different data type

Load and save data

Make plots with the 'ggplot2' package

Vectorisation - use the 'apply' family of functions or 'plyr' package to apply a function to a data structure without looping

Control flow
	Control statements - 'if', 'else'
	Loops - 'for', 'while'
	Break out of a loop when a condition is met, using 'break'
	Skip to the next iteration of a loop, using 'next'

Debugging - use:
	'browser()' to single step through code
	'try()' to "catch" errors


### 'Week4' - Statistics in R, October 24-28 ###


### 'Week5' - Spatial Analyses and GIS (Geographic Information Systems), October 31 - November 4 ###


### 'Week6' - Genomics and Bioinformatics, November 7-11 ###
Basic population genomics
 Calculate genotype and allele frequencies
 Test for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium
 Identify SNPs with big departures from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium


### 'Week7' - Advanced Python, November 14-18 ###
Regular expressions

Number crunching with the 'scipy' package
	Scipy arrays
	'scipy.integrate' subpackage (for numerical integration)

Profiling - know which parts of code take the most time - useful for optimising speed
	'%run -p' iPython magic command
	'timeit' package

Plot/visualise networks using the 'networkx' (Python) and 'igraph' (R) packages

SQLite databases

'subprocess' package - using Python to run other applications, like R


### 'CMEEMiniProject' ###


### 'HPC_Exercises' - High Performance Computing ###
